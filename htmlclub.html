                  As part of this Professional certificate program, I have learned:
                  - Best practices for TensorFlow, a popular open-source machine learning framework to train a neural network for a computer vision applications.
                   -Handle real-world image data and explore strategies to prevent overfitting, including augmentation and dropout.
                      -Build natural language processing systems using TensorFlow.
                     -Apply RNNs, GRUs, and LSTMs as you train them using text repositories.
